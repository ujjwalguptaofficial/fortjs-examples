# Fortjs

fortjs is a lightweight and efficient web framework for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) that empowers developers to build scalable and performant applications with ease. With a focus on simplicity and speed, fortjs provides a robust foundation for creating web APIs and applications. Featuring intuitive routing, dependency injection, and a powerful middleware system, fortjs allows you to craft clean, organized architectures.

fortjs goes beyond the basics by introducing reusable components such as walls, shields, and guards. Walls define the structure of your application, shields protect routes with ease, and guards provide a flexible way to manage authentication and authorization. Say goodbye to boilerplate code and welcome a fortress for building modern and efficient Node.js web applications

# Benchmark

Fortjs is **3x faster** than express and nestjs both.
